      <p>The wind was blowing through the window hole. It was a tiny flinge at the right corner: a wide white window. The hole comes from that bad job Trob made: thirty years from now. The wind was blowing: a lot. </p>

      <p>She was crying; the degree in her hands. Twelve years to light up the grandma promises. The elder was standing next to the girl, shaking professors' hands. We were all worried about how it could end. Now it is over.

      <p>Nothing left but the eggs. The empty plate gained a shiny look. Crystal shades were reflecting the light bulbs of the line: red, fuchsia, green and cyan. Hard boled eggs, covered with mayonnaise; they were sweet and sour, nobody knew why; they were glossy, fat and lukewarm. Alpert cooked them kindly for everybody, leaving just a note before going to the train station. </p>

      <p>The pork sandwitch was one of worst he'd ever had (probably the ery worst); filled with a filthy spread of industrial sauces, the tomatoes could do nothing but lay.
